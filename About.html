        Hello! My name is Aadhya and I am a rising sophomore at North Creek high school. In my spare time I like to
        read, listen to music, play the guitar, and research topics that I find interesting. However, as I grow older, I
        find that I have less time to take care of myself and do the things I enjoy. I often have so many things to do
        that I can feel overwhelmed and burnt out. I wanted to make this website to help others like me who struggle
        with finding a balance between their work and personal life. This website is meant to remind people that
        sometimes the best way to be productive is to take a break and listen to music, or read a book. I hope this
        website helps you take time for yourself!</p>

      <p>Hi! My name is Ari and I'm a rising sophmore that goes to International school. I love reading, watching new     
       shows, and playing volleyball. Over quarantine, I struggled with my mental health and taking care of myself 
       without feeling selfish. Since then, I've been
        passionate about mental health and psychology and was happy to create a website that focuses on self-care. I hope 
       our website has
        a
        positive influence on your life. Welcome to Utopia! </p>

        Hi Everyone! My name is Tadisa! I'm a rising senior in highschool, well we call it 5th form or form 5 here. I
        live
        in Namibia but go to boarding school in Zimbabwe. Mental health has always been something really important to me
        but growing up I didn't always know how to approach self care. Right now at the ripe age of 17 I've finally
        found
        my feet and I'm hoping to help a bunch of other people find theirs when it comes to self care. This website is
        something we are happily gifting to people who may have the same issue that I did or just need some suggestions.
        I
        hope you enjoy all the books and playlists courtesy of Utopia!</p>

        Hi!! My name is Rayan and i'm a rising junior in highschool here in seattle. I can't really say that i have that
        many hobbies but I am trying to find more about myself and decide what it is that I enjoy. I spend most of of my
        free time on my phone which isn't the best thing but it is through this that I have realized the importance of
        selfcare. I still struggle with realising when i need a break but thats ok, it's a process!! Through this
        website
        I hope to pass down my knowledge to those who may be strugguling with the same issue! I hope Utopia becomes a
        safe
        space for you all!
